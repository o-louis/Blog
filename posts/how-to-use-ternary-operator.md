Ternary operator is a substitute of the if/else statement. This is the only operator that use three operands.

```js
<condition> ? <value if true> : <value if false>
```

If/Else :

```js
if (horrorMovie) {
  movie = "Rec";
} else {
  movie = "Spiderman";
}
```
Can be shortened like this :

```js
movie = horrorMovie ? "Rec" : "Spiderman";
```
